//Exercise 2.1 - int is guaranteed to be at least 16 bits, long 32 bits, long long 64 bits, and short 16 bits.
//unsigned types use all of the bits to define the value whereas signed types use one bit to denote pos/neg.
//float has single precision (6 sig digits), double has double precision (10 sig digits)

//Exercise 2.2 - double or float, depending on the machine

//Exercise 2.3
//32
//wrap around
//32
//-32
//0
//0

//012 is an octal, 0xC is hexadecimal
//3.14 is a double, 3.14F is a float, 3.14 is a long double
//10 is a decimal, 10u is unsigned decimal, 10. is double, 10e-2 is double

//Exercise 2.6 - the first is decimal types and would equate to September 7th. The second is octal types and would
//produce a compiler error since 9 is out of octal's range.

//Exercise 2.11 - a: definition, b: definition, c: declaration

//Exercise 2.12 - a: invalid (keyword), b: valid as long as within a function, c: invalid - contains an
